       With a {fitness} fitness level, your chances are low.
       Most likely you will be the first to fall and be turned into a zombie.
       Honestly, {combact} wonâ€™t be of much help to you.

       Even with a {fitness} fitness level, your chances are slim.
       To be honest, you will probably survive a couple of days max
       by leveraging your {combact} skills.
       If I were you I would start training asap.
